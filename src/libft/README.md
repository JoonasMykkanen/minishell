### C standard library functions from scratchðŸ¤“
Since we are only allowed to use functions we have written ourselves, this repo contains most of the functions that are needed for other project's during my school. There are also some usefull functions outside of stdlib added here.

### Important note
This was my schools first project, I started writing it with 0 knowledge of C or any other programming language what so ever.
Some of the function implementations are over complicated or just plain unefficent. I have decided to leave them as is since,
they are a nice point of reference to where I started vs where I am now.

## Worthy mentions

## ft_printfðŸ“ 
writing to stdout without printf is just way too much work... putnbr, putstr, putchar etc. So as a bonus to stdlib functions, I added my own implementation of printf to make my future project's during school that much easier.

## Dynamic vecorsðŸ§ 
Working with strings in C is tedious and it is easy to mess up and leave memory leak behind...ðŸ’¥
Dynamic vector is a small library of memory management functions that behave more like java on python instead of C.
`push(), pop(), new(), delete()` etc..

## getnextlineä·‰
This function read's a fd one line at a time. After diving into it turned out to be harder than expected.
